In this project, I built a dynamic customer support chatbot using Dialogflow and integrated it with a Streamlit interface for real-time interactions. 

The chatbot is designed to handle multiple user queries like order status, refunds, cancellations, and product updates. 

I configured Dialogflow with intents, entities, and contexts to ensure seamless conversation flow and accurate responses. I implemented session management and fallback handling to enhance the chatbotâ€™s robustness and ensure smooth user interactions. The Streamlit interface provides an intuitive, user-friendly platform for real-time queries, while Google Cloud Services power the backend to ensure quick and accurate response generation.
